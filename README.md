# Learning-JS-with-ChatGPT

In this project, I will be using ChatGPT to ask question regarding JavaScript. The scope will include anything from syntax, learning built-in methods, to algorythms and data structures.

The purpose of this project is to see how ChatGPT can be used to learn programming material by using prompts for it to create a curriculum, and coding snippets to that chellenge me and prove my understanding of any relevant subject material. I will use ChatGPT to create challenges for me to solve and provide them here in this repo.
